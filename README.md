This repo contains my attempts at Advent of Code.

As a rule, these attempts are for my own fun, and for refreshing my skills. As such, in years prior to 2023, I stopped when I hit a raodblock.

Starting in 2023, I am using AoC to sharpen my skills, find my weaknesses, and learn what I need to learn.

That said, AoC is still suppose to be fun - if I get too stuck, or find a prompt un-fun, I have allowed myself to skip forward to the next prompt (keeping the branch alive for later attempts and posterity).
